We are going to create an API --> this will allow us to expose a list of all the products in a database and the details of a single product using the json file format

# What is it about
We eill set up 2 endpoints for our API
1) will allow users to retrieve information about a specific product instance
2) will allow users to retrieve a list of all available products

We are going to build our API Views only using the functions and classes provided by "pure" Django, and our API will make use of the JSON file format

# Step 1
change views.py

# Step 2: set up our first endpoint (in the same way in which we would normally mach a function based view to an url)
change urls.py (in app)
